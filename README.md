Analyzing Police Activity

Skills involved: Python Exploratory Analysis, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.                              
Explored the 'Stanford Open Policing Project dataset' to answer these and other questions by analyzing the dataset.
Impact of gender on police behavior? 
If drug-related stops on the rise?
Worked on cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, reshaping dataframes, and manipulating time series data.
Drew insights that the vehicle search rate is about 3.8% of total people pulled over. About 45% of male drivers are searched which is more than twice as often as female drivers(~19%).
Tested this hypothesis for all types of violations and found that the search rate is ~30% higher for males and frisk rate ~20% more for males, though we can't conclude that this difference is caused by the driver's gender.
The rate of drug-related stops nearly doubled over the course of 10 years between 2005-15 even though search rate decreased.
