# Analyzing-Police-Activity

To understand the latest police activity trends in Rhode Island, explored the 'Stanford Open Policing Project dataset' and analyzed the impact of gender on police behavior. I worked on cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data
The code for this can be found in the 'Analyzing-Police-Activity' ipynb file. 
You can download the data here.
